# Fetch Rewards Data Analyst Assessment

## Part 1: Explore the data

The files ProductsExploration.py, TransactionsExploration.py, and UsersExploration.py contain code to give an overview of the Products, Transation, and User files respectively.
A write-up is found in "Fetch Assessment - Part 1.docx".
The plots included in the write-up are also included in the folder "Data Exploration Plots".

## Part 2: Provide SQL queries

I answered the following three questions:
1. "What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?"
2. "What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?"
3. "Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?"
A write-up with full context is found in Fetch Assessment - Part 2.docx.
The three queries that I wrote to answer the questions can be found in "Queries\_Part\_2.sql".
The outputs of the three queries can be found in "Data\_Brands\_21\_Plus.csv", "Data\_Generations\_Health.csv", and "Data\_Dips\_Salsa.csv", respectively.
These files are located within the folder "SQL Query Outputs".

**Note:** The SQL queries are written for PostgreSQL. Syntax may vary in MySQL, SQL Server, or other SQL implementations.

## Part 3: Communicate with stakeholders

The file "Fetch Assessment - Part 3.docx" contains the body of an email addressed to a stakeholder who is unfamiliar with the day-to-day work of a data analyst.
The file "Queries\_Full.sql" contains the SQL queries from Part 2 as well as extra queries which support conclusions referenced in the body of the email.
Additional query outputs referenced in the email can be found within the "SQL Query Outputs" folder.
